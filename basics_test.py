Q_1, 
Make a calculator using the 3 user inputs (1st number, 2nd number, and the operation needed to be sunducted between them)

The user needs to be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide, raise them to a interger (powers) and root them to a integer

ex. 8 of root 3 = 2

#completed the captcha test to check if you are human.
"""
Q_2, 
Make a script that takes the a string from the user and switches the capitalisation of alphabets in the string alternatively(with first letter capital).

ex. "hello world 123four" = "HeLlO wOrLd 123FoUr"

"""
#meh
"""
Q_3,
Make a visual multiplication table with the square dimension of user specification (11 will make a 11x11 table).
This table should not display any square numbers (1 is square number as 1x1 = 1, with "LoL" in its empty place).
This table also should be positioned in the way that the smallest value is in the top-right corner and the highest value in the bottom-right corner.

The table should only show numbers and it should have all first digits of the numbers perfectly aligned in the xy-axis, no matter even if there are numbers range from 1 to 4 digits in different places.
(including aligning the first L of LoL)

ex. with user input 4,

    4    3    2    LoL
    8    6    LoL  2
    12   LoL  6    3
    LoL  12   8    4

"""
Q_4,
Make a database for all numbers until the user specification (0 nnot included),
The information should be revealed on user calling only (cannot display everything at once)
The information stored should contain: whether if its an odd number or even number, whether if its a prime number (1 is not prime), 
and whether or not the current number inputed is the same as the last number inquired for (its a default no on the first try)

ex. with maximum set to 100,
>>3
    1. odd or even?
    2. prime number?
    3. same shit again?
>>1
    odd
>>1
    1. odd or even?
    2. prime number?
    3. same shit again?
>>3
    nope
