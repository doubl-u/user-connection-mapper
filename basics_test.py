#all functions should run in a loop repeatedly unless the keyword "quit" is typed in at any point in time. no external online help or external libraries :)
"""
Q_1, 
Make a calculator using the 3 user inputs (1st number, 2nd number, and the operation needed to be sunducted between them)

The user needs to be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide, raise them to a interger (powers) and root them to a integer

ex. 8 of root 3 (cuberoot) = 2
    8 + 3 = 11

"""
#completed the captcha test to check if you are human.
"""
Q_2, 
Make a script that takes the a string from the user and switches the capitalisation of alphabets in the string alternatively (with first letter of the sentence, capital).

ex. "hello world 123four" = "HeLlO wOrLd 123FoUr"

"""
#meh
"""
Q_3,
Make a visual multiplication table with the square dimension of user specification (11 will make a 11x11 table).
This table should not display any square numbers (1 is square number as 1x1 = 1, with "LoL" in its empty place).
This table also should be positioned in the way that the smallest value is in the top-right corner and the highest value in the bottom-left corner.

The table should only show numbers and it should have all first digits of the numbers perfectly aligned in the xy-axis, no matter even if there are numbers range from 1 to 4 digits in different places.
(including aligning the first L of LoL)

ex. with user input 4,

    LoL  3    2    LoL
    8    6    LoL  2
    12   LoL  6    3
    LoL  12   8    LoL

not:
    LoL 3 2 LoL
    8 6 LoL 2
    12 LoL 6 3
    LoL 12 8 LoL

"""
#was seeing whether your brain cells were intact, but impressive 
"""
Q_4,
Make a database for all numbers until the user specification (0 not included),
The information should be revealed on user calling only (cannot display everything at once)
The information stored should contain: whether if it's in the fibonacci sequence (1,1,2,3,5,8,.. where the sum of last two numbers make the next) , whether if its a prime number (1 is not prime), 
and whether or not the current number inputed is the same as the last number inquired for (its a default no on the first try)

It should done in one main python file and two functional supplementary modules

ex. 
>>100
    numbers from 1 to 100 can be searched for.
>>3
    1. in the fibonacci Sequence?
    2. prime number?
    3. same shit again?
>>1
    Yep
>>1
    1. in the fibonacci Sequence?
    2. prime number?
    3. same shit again?
>>3
    nope
